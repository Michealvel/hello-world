# hello-world

Greetings Everyone
This is Vel Baah, but you can call me Michael. I am a veteran that woke up and realized that coding can do a lot of things and solve problems. Well, I am looking to solve problems that would make a difference. In my spare time, I like to play soccer, read, and listen to podcasts that interest me.
